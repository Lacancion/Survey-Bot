# Survey-Bot
NVIDIA academy project
Surveyor bot is a model that was with the "Different Terrain Types Classification" dataset by Durgesh Rao, which includes 799 images for each of four terrainsâ€”desert, forest, mountain, and plains. With Surveyor-Bot, one can skip the paperwork and automate the tedious work of land surveying!

># The Algorithm
>This model is a version of the resnet 18 convolutional neural network. ResNet-18 is a deep network that uses shortcuts to improve training. It has multiple stages with increasing filters and combines convolutional and residual blocks for better performance. The dataset that I fine tuned it with had a wide variety of satellite images of forests, deserts, plains and mountains. 
> # Downloading Instructions
1. Procure a Jetson Nano
2. Download the Jetson-Infrence library and Python 3 on to your Jetson nano
3. Create a folder named Survey-Bot inside your Jetson Nano, you can nam3e it anything
4. Go to the ResNet-18 model and dowload into the folder you just created
